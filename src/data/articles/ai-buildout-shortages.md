The numbers get thrown around with an air of inevitability: $700 billion committed to AI infrastructure. Hyperscalers racing to build data centers. A new industrial revolution. What gets less attention is what that buildout physically requires — and what it's taking from.

## Data Centers Are Construction Projects

The abstraction of "the cloud" obscures a concrete reality. A modern AI data center is an industrial facility spanning hundreds of acres, consuming as much electricity as a small city, requiring thousands of workers to build. The mechanical and electrical systems alone — cooling, power distribution, backup generators, fiber optic cabling — demand highly specialized labor.

Data center construction spending rose 32% in 2025 compared to the prior year. For other commercial real estate, spending was essentially flat. The AI boom isn't lifting all boats — it's redirecting the river.

## The Labor Squeeze

Electricians, HVAC technicians, and fiber optic installers are being drawn to data center projects that pay premium wages. In some markets, competition for these workers has driven construction costs up 20 to 30 percent across the board.

The construction industry will need 456,000 new workers by 2027 — a 31% increase over current demand. These aren't entry-level positions. The specialized electrical and mechanical work in data centers requires years of training and certification.

Data center projects can afford to pay more, so they get first pick. Apartment buildings, hospital expansions, factories, and infrastructure repairs compete for what remains — at higher prices and longer timelines.

## What Gets Delayed

When hospitals take longer to build, healthcare access suffers. When apartment construction slows, housing supply tightens in already-strained markets. When infrastructure maintenance gets deferred because crews are wiring data centers, the deferred maintenance compounds.

There's a consumer goods dimension too. The same chips and manufacturing capacity that go into server hardware also go into smartphones, cars, and consumer electronics. As AI infrastructure absorbs more of the global semiconductor supply, prices for everything else drift upward.

## The Capital Concentration Problem

When $700 billion flows into a single sector in a compressed timeframe, it creates distortions. Investment that might have gone to clean energy, housing, or manufacturing gets redirected or crowded out.

This pattern isn't new. Railroad booms, the late-1990s fiber optic buildout, the fracking rush — concentrated investment creates local abundance and broader scarcity. The question is always whether the returns justify the displacement. Railroads created lasting infrastructure despite speculative excess. Fiber optics left behind a backbone we still use. Whether AI data centers generate comparable long-term value is the multitrillion-dollar question that hasn't been answered yet.

## What to Watch

**Wage data in construction trades.** If electrician wages keep rising significantly faster than inflation, the labor squeeze is structural, not temporary.

**Data center utilization rates.** High capacity usage in 2-3 years means the buildout was well-calibrated. Low utilization means we overbuilt — again.

**Housing starts and public infrastructure spending.** If these decline as data center construction rises, the displacement effect is real and worsening.

The clearest takeaway: the AI revolution has a physical footprint, and the costs of that footprint are being distributed across the economy in ways that aren't immediately visible but are increasingly consequential.
