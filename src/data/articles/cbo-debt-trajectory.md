## The Numbers

The CBO's February 2026 outlook paints the clearest picture yet of America's fiscal trajectory, and it's steep. Federal debt held by the public — currently at 99% of GDP — will cross 100% this year, hit a new record of 108% by 2030, and reach 120% by 2036. For context, the previous record was set during World War II.

Cumulative deficits over the next decade total $24.4 trillion, averaging 6.1% of GDP. That's more than double the 50-year historical average of 3.7%.

## Where the Money Goes

The fastest-growing line item isn't Social Security or defense — it's interest on existing debt. Net interest payments will rise from $970 billion (3.2% of GDP) in 2025 to $2.1 trillion (4.6% of GDP) by 2036. At that point, the government will spend more servicing its debt than on national defense, Medicaid, or any single discretionary program.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act — the 2025 reconciliation package — adds roughly $4.2 trillion to the debt through 2034. Meanwhile, tariffs are projected to bring in $3.0 trillion in new revenue over the same period, partially offsetting the spending but falling well short of closing the gap.

## Two Clocks Ticking

Two major trust funds are running out of money. The Highway Trust Fund hits insolvency in 2028 — just two years away. Social Security's Old-Age and Survivors fund runs dry in 2032, which under current law would trigger automatic 17-21% benefit cuts for retirees.

Congress has historically intervened before trust fund exhaustion, but the shrinking timeline narrows the window for politically viable fixes. Any Social Security reform package takes years to design and implement.

## The Tariff Gamble

The CBO's revenue projections lean heavily on tariff income — $3.4 trillion of the $4.2 trillion in projected revenue increases comes from customs duties. That's a historically unusual revenue source that carries real risks: tariffs face ongoing legal challenges, can be reversed by executive action, and tend to dampen the economic activity they tax. If tariff revenue underperforms, the deficit picture gets significantly worse.

## What to Watch

- **Interest rate sensitivity.** CBO assumes rates stay elevated. If they rise further, interest costs compound faster than projected.
- **Trust fund legislation.** Whether Congress acts on Social Security before 2032 or waits for the automatic cuts to force action.
- **Tariff durability.** Legal challenges and trade negotiations could reduce tariff revenue below projections.
- **GDP growth.** CBO projects 2.2% growth in 2026, slowing to 1.8% after. Slower growth means less revenue and higher deficits.
