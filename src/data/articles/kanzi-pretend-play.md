In February 2026, *Science* published a study that sounds like a children's party invitation: researchers hosted a tea party for a bonobo. The results challenge assumptions about what imagination is, where it comes from, and who gets to have it.

## The Experiments

Christopher Krupenye at Johns Hopkins and Amalia Bastos (now at the University of St. Andrews) designed three experiments around Kanzi, a 43-year-old bonobo at Ape Initiative who had been trained to communicate using lexigrams and could respond to spoken English.

The setup was simple. In the first experiment, the researcher pretended to pour juice from a pitcher into two cups, then mimed dumping the juice from one cup. When asked "Where's the juice?" — Kanzi pointed to the cup that still contained the pretend juice. He tracked the imaginary liquid across spatial manipulations, even when the cups were moved.

In the second experiment, one cup held real juice, the other pretend juice. When offered a choice, Kanzi almost always chose the real juice — demonstrating he could distinguish between actual and imaginary objects while simultaneously maintaining a representation of both.

The third experiment replicated the logic with pretend grapes in jars. Again, Kanzi reliably identified where the imaginary objects were.

## Why Imagination Matters

This isn't about whether a bonobo can be cute at a tea party. It's about secondary representation — the ability to hold a mental model of something that doesn't exist and update it as conditions change. When a child pretends a banana is a phone, they're doing something cognitive scientists consider uniquely sophisticated: maintaining two simultaneous representations of the same object (what it is and what it's pretending to be).

This capacity has long been considered a human monopoly, emerging in children around age two. Finding it in a bonobo suggests the cognitive architecture for imagination predates the human-ape split 6 to 9 million years ago.

## The Caveats Worth Taking Seriously

Kanzi was exceptional — deeply enculturated, language-trained from infancy, and studied for decades. He's not a typical bonobo. The researchers are careful to say this demonstrates the *cognitive potential* of great apes, not that all bonobos walk around imagining things. Whether wild apes use pretense spontaneously remains an open question.

There's also the question of what "imagination" means here. Kanzi tracked pretend objects, but did he *experience* imagining them the way a child does? The behavioral evidence is compelling; the subjective question is, as usual, unanswerable from the outside.

Kanzi died in 2025 at age 44. This study, years in the making, is among his last contributions to science.

## What to Watch

- Whether other great apes (non-language-trained) can pass similar pretense tests. If so, it's not just Kanzi — it's the lineage.
- How this intersects with the ongoing consciousness indicators work. If imagination requires secondary representation, and secondary representation is an indicator of consciousness, the circle of morally relevant minds may be wider than we've assumed.
- The broader pattern: as we ask harder questions about machine consciousness, the parallel conversation about animal consciousness keeps delivering answers that shrink the gap between human minds and everything else.
