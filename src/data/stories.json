    "headline": "China's deflation problem persists as January inflation undershoots forecasts",
    "summary": "China's CPI rose just 0.2% year-over-year in January, half the 0.4% economists expected and a sharp deceleration from December's 0.8%. Producer prices fell 1.4%, marking over two years of factory-gate deflation. Lunar New Year timing distorts the comparison, but the trend is clear: domestic demand remains weak despite repeated stimulus measures.",
    "why_it_matters": "Persistent deflation in the world's second-largest economy isn't just a China problem. It suppresses commodity prices globally, puts downward pressure on global goods inflation, and signals that Beijing's stimulus toolkit isn't generating the demand recovery it needs. Watch whether this forces more aggressive policy action ahead of the March NPC session.",

    "headline": "Trump and Netanyahu meet for three hours on Iran nuclear talks, agree to keep negotiating",
    "summary": "Netanyahu flew to Washington a week early to weigh in on US-Iran nuclear negotiations that resumed last week in Oman. After a three-hour Oval Office meeting, Trump said nothing definitive was reached but he insisted negotiations continue. Netanyahu pushed for any deal to include limits on Iran's ballistic missiles and an end to support for proxy groups — not just nuclear enrichment.",
    "why_it_matters": "The question is whether the US pursues a narrow nuclear deal (freeze enrichment, lift sanctions) or a broader one Israel wants (missiles, proxies, regional behavior). Iran has already rejected expanding the scope. Netanyahu's early trip signals real concern that a narrow deal is taking shape without Israeli input.",

    "headline": "Data centers are projected to consume 3% of global electricity by 2030, tripling from today",
    "summary": "A new Precedence Research report projects global data center electricity consumption will hit 945 TWh by 2030 and 1,300 TWh by 2035 — up from roughly 460 TWh today. Sensitivity analysis shows demand could range from 700 TWh to 1,700 TWh by 2035 depending on AI adoption rates and efficiency gains. The IEA expects data centers to account for over 20% of electricity demand growth in advanced economies this decade.",
    "why_it_matters": "These numbers put concrete scale on AI's physical footprint. For context, 1,300 TWh is roughly equivalent to Japan's entire annual electricity consumption. This is why Meta is signing 6.6 GW nuclear deals and why the AI buildout is reshaping energy markets — the demand curve is steep enough to strain grids even with massive investment.",

    "summary": "LONGi has pushed perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell efficiency to nearly 35%, well past the theoretical limit for single-junction silicon cells (~29%). A Nature paper this month demonstrated a flexible tandem cell at 33.6% — significant because flexible panels open applications rigid panels can't reach. Jinko Solar is targeting 34% efficiency in mass production this year.",
    "why_it_matters": "Silicon solar hit its ceiling. Perovskite tandems are the next step function in efficiency, and 2026 is when they move from lab records to commercial products. If manufacturing scales successfully, it would meaningfully accelerate the economics of solar deployment at a time when electricity demand from AI is surging.",

    "summary": "The US economy added 130,000 jobs in January, nearly double the 70K consensus forecast and the strongest month since December 2024. Health care led with 82K, construction added 33K, while federal government lost 34K as DOGE-era layoffs hit the payroll count. Unemployment held at 4.3%.",
    "why_it_matters": "The headline number looks healthy, but the annual benchmark revision is the real story. BLS slashed 862,000 jobs from 2025 data, meaning last year averaged just 15K jobs per month — far weaker than reported in real time. The labor market may have been softer for longer than anyone realized.",

    "summary": "Data center construction spending rose 32% in 2025, pulling electricians, HVAC techs, and fiber optic installers away from other projects. Construction costs in some markets are up 20-30%. The industry will need 456,000 new workers by 2027, a 31% increase over this year's demand. Apartments, factories, and healthcare facilities are being delayed as a result.",
    "why_it_matters": "This is the kind of second-order effect that rarely gets covered. AI isn't just a software story — it requires massive physical infrastructure, and that buildout is competing with everything else for finite skilled labor and materials.

    "summary": "The Commerce Department is designing a tariff carve-out system that would let Taiwanese chipmakers import chips tariff-free in proportion to their planned US manufacturing capacity — up to 2.5x during construction, 1.5x for existing plants. The exemptions would effectively shield major cloud providers from the next wave of semiconductor tariffs.",
    "why_it_matters": "This is industrial policy dressed as trade policy. The message to TSMC: build fabs in America, and your biggest customers won't pay tariffs on your imports in the meantime. It keeps AI data center costs down while incentivizing domestic chip production. Plans aren't finalized — worth watching whether this becomes a broader template.",

The Commerce Department has until March 11 to identify state regulations it deems burdensome. In a particularly aggressive move, the administration is conditioning $42 billion in broadband infrastructure funding on states repealing certain AI regulations.",
    "why_it_matters": "Over 100 state AI laws were enacted last year while the federal government pursued deregulation. This is the collision.
